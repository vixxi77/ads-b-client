ADS-B Plane traking project

Will feature:

-Raylib client (retro looking ahh)
- Raw C posix socket comms with server
-.NET Server
-Maybe htmx web client too
-SBC Node with ads-b antenna with SDR 
-Server hosted on a VPS (but will try to host on my own servers and use VPS as a proxy)
-Read only backend for clients

Strectch goal:

-Entire system could be ran entirely by home grown server
-VPS is for routing traffic from the SBC to my home server and back to clients
